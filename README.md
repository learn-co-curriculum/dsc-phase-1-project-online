## Creating Successful Original Content
### First Thoughts and Hypothesis

In the recent years, the popularity of streaming services has been revolutionized by big tech companies such as YouTube, Netflix, HBO and many others. Consumer's habits have changed in response to this. Why pay for movie tickets at the theater when you can stay home and watch whatever you'd like? 

Because of this trend, we decided to look at success rates of movies and TV shows in the past years to better advise Microsoft in creating successful orginal content. To determine success, it's necessary to look at key areas of the entertainment industry - viewership, ratings, and award nominations. After researching these three areas, we've determined the best route to successful original content is by creating a TV series. 

### Question 1: What type of content is most successful today? 
#### What type of content being created today? 

The first question anyone looking to create original content asks is, "What should we create?" By looking what is currently being created, and the trend over the last several years is a good place to start. Considering the current socialeconomic situation, it can be expected that a majority of people will be engaging with original content from their homes. Because of this, we decided to look at types of content being published on streaming services. 

Below, the trends for both TV shows and movies are obvious. While movie production has begun to sharply decline in the past five years, TV shows are being released at a quickly increasing rate.

#### TV Shows are being produced at a higher rate than movies, but are they also more popular? 

Although TV Shows are being produced at a higher rate than moves, that doesn't necessarily mean they're more popular with viewers. To determine what viewers are consuming, we turned to the Netflix Daily Top 10. Earlier this year Netflix released a universal Daily Top 10, which shows the viewer the ten most popular shows and movies for that day. This data, as we can clearly see below, proved that TV Shows are more popular than movies. On average, a TV shows is more likely to appear on the Top 10 list for more days than a movie. TV shows also received higher viewership scores than movies.

### Question 2: Which network or streaming service would best support our series?   
#### Which network has received the most award nominations in the last four years? 

Award shows are a great way to evaluate the success of a TV show. The Emmy's are well-known and much talked about, making this the perfect award show to help us determine which network or streaming service would be the best platform to host a new TV show.

After pulling shows and actors nominated for major award from the Emmy's site, it was obvious that several networks have been more successful than others over the last few years. As you can see in the chart below, HBO, Netflix and Prime Video have out-performed all other networks with clearly HBO in the lead.

#### Which networks are receiving the most independent show and actor nominations? 

Looking at the top three winningest networks, we can see that HBO not only has the highest number of show nominations, but also the most individual actor nominations. 

Of the two award nominations available, the first being a show nomination and the second an actor nomination, HBO is clearly leading the pack in both. Netflix succeeds in show nominations, but has few actor nominations. The below graph also shows that while Netflix has received many nominations for multiple shows, those shows are only nominated for a maximum of 3 awards while some HBO shows have been nominated twice that amount.

#### Finally, which network has had the most shows nominated within the last two years? 

Taking a look at the past two years, we can see that seven HBO shows, nine Netflix shows, and only two Prime Video shows have been nominated for an Emmy. One could argue that Netflix has been the most successful considering they have a higher number of shows nominated, however you can see below that the six HBO shows were nominated for a larger number of awards than the Netflix shows. This means that the six HBO shows are more successful than the nine Netflix shows.

#### We believe that HBO is the best network to host Microsoft's new original TV series.

Above, we presented three arguments that present HBO as the clear choice: 
1. From 2017-2020, HBO shows have collected more nominations than the competing networks 
2. HBO not only has the largest number of aggregate nominations, they also are more successful at both a series and actor leve 
3. While Netflix has had more shows nominated for awards in the last two years, HBO is close behind and shows a higher success rate per show than Netflix 

Finally, HBO also proves to draw a larger viewership than other popular networks further solidifying the recommendation to choose HBO to host a new TV show.

### Question 3: What type of show will be profitable? 
#### Insight

In todays subscription structured business models, two of the most important variables that determines success are viewership and ratings. 

#### Which genres generate the most views? 

With this in mind, I found viewership numbers from four popular networks. From this analysis there were five genres with the most views for TV series. They are as follows:

1. Drama
2. Comedy
3. Crime
4. Action
5. Fantasy

#### Which genres are most highly rated? 

After seeing that the genres above were clearly viewed at a much higher rate than others, I wanted to know which of those genres had the highest rating. Expecting Comedy or Drama to have the highest ratings, it was surprising to find that Fantasy actually had the most top ratings.

#### Which genre should Microsoft choose for their new TV series? 

It's clear that Drama is the most viewed genre for all four networks. Comedy, Action and Crime genres all trail close behind and could also be worth investment. 

In order to break into this industry, I would recommend developing a tv series with the genre Drama being the foundation, considering Drama drives the highest number of viewers for all four networks as seen below. Because Fantasy and Crime shows appear to pull highest ratings, adding a Fantasy or Crime element could be beneficial.

### Conclusion

To create successful original content, we recommend the following: 

1. Create a TV show as opposed to a movie 
2. Work with HBO, the most successful network to host the new TV show
3. Create a show with a main genre of Drama while possibly adding elements of either Fantasy or Crime to drive ratings
